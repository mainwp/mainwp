# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

[Patchstack](https://patchstack.com/) runs a Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) that invites ethical hackers to report security vulnerabilities. Rewards are offered based on the severity of the reported issue.

We encourage researchers to report vulnerabilities on our Patchstack pages for MainWP [Dashboard](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/mainwp) and [Child](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/mainwp-child) plugin. Please review our policy before submitting a report.

Thank you for helping us improve the security of our plugins.
