# Developer

The MainWP WordPress management system consists of 2 core plugins, the MainWP Dashboard plugin which is containted in this repository.   The second plugin is the MainWP Child plugin, which can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/mainwp/mainwp-child).  

The [MainWP Dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp/) is a stand-alone plugin that is installed on its own WordPress site; no other plugins should be installed with it, and it should not be installed on an active WordPress site with visitors. 

The [MainWP Child](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-child/) plugin is installed on the WordPress sites that you want to control from the MainWP Dashboard.
