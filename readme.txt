Manage WP sites from one central location! Much more than just updates, get nearly complete control of all your sites from your self-hosted Dashboard.

== Description ==

[MainWP](https://mainwp.com) is the only free, fully open source and self-hosted WordPress management plugin available.

And, just because it is free does not mean it’s been stripped down.   The MainWP Dashboard allows you to control virtually all of your daily WordPress maintenance tasks at absolutely no cost. 

The Dashboard plugin allows you to connect and control completely independent WordPress sites even those on different hosts and servers.

MainWP is the perfect solution for affiliates, marketers, developers, WordPress shops and anyone else with multiple WordPress sites. 

= How is MainWP free, what’s the catch, how will you continue to pay development costs? = 

We make money by selling [Extensions](https://mainwp.com/extensions/).

Extensions enhance your MainWP Dashboard with additional features. The catalog of [MainWP Extensions](https://mainwp.com/extensions/) include additional features for backups, marketing, SEO, maintenance, security, monitoring and other tools to help you build a better network.

**Note:  MainWP requires two (2) plugins.**

**This is the MainWP Dashboard plugin that you install on your own separate WordPress install and the [MainWP child plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-child/) that you install on the sites you want to control (child sites) .**

Please check the [Quick Start - Setting up your MainWP](http://docs.mainwp.com/setting-up-your-mainwp/) support doc for more information.

= Everything below and more is included in the MainWP Plugins at absolutely no charge, no tricks, no hidden fees, no nickel and diming you for every little feature and absolutely no gotchas! =

= Some of the Free MainWP Features include: =

= Easy Management =
MainWP takes the hassle out of managing your themes and plugins. The MainWP Dashboard allows easy review of which of your WordPress sites have themes and plugins that need updating. 

Just one click will update all of your plugins and themes across all your sites.

= Effortless Upgrades =
Do you have a busy schedule and dread all of the work you’ll be putting into upgrading to the latest version of WordPress? Worry no more! With the click of a button from your MainWP dashboard, all of your WordPress sites will be upgraded to the latest stable version.  

= One Click Access =
Do you have too many WordPress sites to remember? Accessing all of your WordPress sites is now a breeze with our intuitive one-click access. Navigate to your sites sub-menu and click the admin link to open, and you’re instantly logged in and ready to work directly in that child site! 

= Automated Updates =
Using the Trusted Plugin and Theme option in your MainWP Dashboard will automatically update all Plugins and Themes that you trust with no further interaction from you. Your MainWP Dashboard will alert you by email with available updates and then will auto-update them the next day.

= Abandoned Plugin and Theme Alerts =
When a plugin or theme hasn't had an update in a long time we tend to forget about it which could lead to security or compatibility issues, your MainWP Dashboard will alert you of possibly abandoned plugins or themes so that you can look for a more updated plugin or theme.

= Multiple Reliable Backup Options =
The MainWP Dashboard offers multiple backup options. We have integrated some of the most popular backup plugins and released them as  [Free Backup Extensions](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-extensions/extension-category/backup/) this allows you to use the backup plugins you know and trust directly from your MainWP Dashboard.

= Ignore Updates =
Is there a plugin or theme that you do not want to update for compatibility or other issues?  Just tell to your MainWP Dashboard to ignore it and it will no longer alert you of the update.

= Content Management =
The power of the MainWP Dashboard means that publishing content to sites is now as easy as can be. Pick your site from a list, write content, and publish, without the hassles of logging into each and every site. It’s just as easy to manage links, comments, and spam using our mass publish and delete functions.

= Bulk Posting =
Posting content to multiple websites can prove difficult with WordPress alone. With the MainWP Dashboard, posting content to multiple blogs couldn’t be easier. Create the content, select your blogs, and enjoy the time you saved.

= Customize Your MainWP =
Extensions offer custom functions and features so that each user can tailor their MainWP installation to their specific needs. 

= Developer?  Code your own Extensions  =
Building on the core principals of WordPress, MainWP allows third party developers to “hook” into it so anything you want can be developed to work within your MainWP Dashboard. You can find more information in the [MainWP Codex](http://codex.mainwp.com).  Build your own Extensions for both fun and profit.

= Self Hosted =
Your MainWP Dashboard is hosted on your own WordPress install and not on our private servers. We do not keep records of your actions, sites, passwords or anything else.

= Discovery Protection =
MainWP protects you from your competitors, search engines or anyone else with prying eyes. No one will ever know you are using MainWP unless you tell them.

= Developer Spy Free =
We know some developers like to keep tight control of what is happening with their plugins but this is your network and we have 100% respect for your privacy. You control and choose the hosting which means we do not have secret access to any of your sites or information.

= Fully Auditable Code =
Both the MainWP Dashboard and Child plugin are fully open source and GPL compliant with no obfuscated code so you always know what is running on your server. Both plugins are also maintained on GitHub for easy code access.

== Installation ==

= Note: MainWP is not tested on or designed for multisite installs, we have reports that most functions work correctly but support will be limited.  We DO NOT recommend installing the MainWP Dashboard plugin on a Multi-site install. = 

1. We HIGHLY recommend a NEW WordPress install for your MainWP Dashboard.

Using a new WordPress install will help to cut down on Plugin Conflicts and other issues that can be caused by trying to run your MainWP Main Dashboard from an active site. Most hosting companies provide free subdomains ("demo.yourdomain.com") and we recommend creating one if you do not have a specific dedicated domain to run your MainWP Dashboard.
If you are not sure how to set up a subdomain here is a quick step by step with [cPanel](http://docs.mainwp.com/creating-a-subdomain-in-cpanel/), [Plesk](http://docs.mainwp.com/creating-a-subdomain-in-plesk/) or [Direct Admin](http://docs.mainwp.com/creating-a-subdomain-in-directadmin-control-panel/). If you are not sure what you have, contact your hosting companies support.

You can even install your MainWP Dashboard on a WordPress site located on your local computer using [DesktopServer](https://mainwp.com/how-to-use-desktopserver-to-run-your-mainwp-dashboard-locally/), WAMP or any other setup that allows you to run [WordPress locally](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/).   

2. Once you have setup the separate WordPress install you can install the MainWP Dashboard plugin following your normal installation procedure either the Automatic process by searching MainWP or by uploading the MainWP plugin to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

3. Once installed then Activate the Plugin through the Plugins Menu in WordPress

4. Add your first child site to the MainWP Dashboard - [Documentation](http://docs.mainwp.com/setting-up-your-mainwp/)

5. Set your MainWP Settings - [Documentation](http://docs.mainwp.com/mainwp-settings-overview/)
