== Your Guarantee of Privacy ==

The MainWP plugins come with their own [privacy policies](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-plugin-privacy-policy/) to ensure that the plugins do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII).


== How Does MainWP Work? ==

First, Install and Activate this MainWP Dashboard plugin on a WordPress site you will use to manage all other sites (even those on different hosting); this is your Dashboard Site.

We highly recommend this be a new, clean WordPress installation and not on one of your production sites. Using a clean site helps to eliminate any unnecessary plugin conflicts or security issues.

Next, Install and Activate the [MainWP Child plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-child/) on all WordPress sites you want to manage from your MainWP Dashboard. WordPress sites connected to your Dashboard are referred to as Child Sites.

Once all Child Sites are connected, your Dashboard can control almost everything about your Child Site(s).

Still, trying to figure out how MainWP works? [Review these detailed steps on installing your Dashboard and connecting your first Child Site.](https://mainwp.com/getting-started-with-mainwp/)

== How Is MainWP Free? What’s the Catch? How Will You Continue to Pay Development Costs? ==

The MainWP WordPress manager plugin is [100% FREE!](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-free-features/) However, MainWP Pro offers a wide range of [32+ Premium Extensions](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-extensions/) at a single price.

👉 [Free vs. Pro: Know the Difference](https://mainwp.com/free-vs-pro/)

Extensions enhance your MainWP Dashboard with additional features for backups, marketing, SEO, maintenance, security, monitoring, and other tools to help you better organize and manage websites.


== Some Powerful MainWP Features: ==

MainWP is a feature-rich WP management plugin to manage multiple sites from a single self-hosted dashboard. Here are some of the highlighted features.

= – Easy WordPress Management =

MainWP, the WP Management plugin, eliminates the hassle of managing multiple sites by highlighting what needs to be done on which Child Site.

With the Easy [Plugin Manager feature](https://mainwp.com/easy-plugin-manager/), you can update specific plugins on selected Child Sites with just a click. Additionally, all themes and WordPress updates can be done the same way.


= – Full Client Management =

With the MainWP Client Management feature, you can create new profiles for your clients, add their contact person details, map websites to specific clients, add tags, suspend clients, and much more!

Take a look at how you can [easily manage your clients](https://kb.mainwp.com/docs/manage-clients/).


= – One-Click Login to wp-admin =

With the click of a button, you’re instantly and securely logged in to the wp-admin of a Child Site and ready to work! No need to remember usernames and passwords anymore!


= – Effortless Upgrades =

With the click of a button from your MainWP WordPress Manager Dashboard, all your WordPress sites will be upgraded to the latest stable version.


= – Automated Updates =

The Trusted Plugin and Theme option in your MainWP Dashboard will [automatically update](https://kb.mainwp.com/docs/manage-updates/) the Trusted Plugins and Themes without further interaction.

You will get an alert via email with available updates, and your Dashboard will auto-update them the next day.


= – Ignore Updates =

Is there a plugin or theme you want to avoid updating for compatibility or other issues? Just tell your MainWP Dashboard to ignore it, and it will no longer alert you of the update.


= – Abandoned Plugin and Theme Alerts =

When a plugin or theme hasn’t been updated in a long time, we tend to forget about it, which could lead to security or compatibility issues.

Your MainWP Dashboard will alert you of possibly abandoned plugins or themes so that you can look for a more updated plugin or theme.


= – Multiple Reliable Backup Options =

The MainWP Dashboard offers multiple backup options. We have integrated some of the most popular backup plugins and released them as [Free Backup Extensions.](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-extensions/extension-category/backup/)

This allows you to use the backup plugins you know and trust directly from your MainWP Dashboard.


= – Content Management =

With the power of the MainWP WordPress management plugin, publishing content to Child Sites is now as easy as possible. Pick your site from a list, write content, and publish without the hassles of logging into each website.

It’s just as easy to manage links, comments, and spam using our mass publish and delete functions.


= – Bulk Posting =

Posting content to multiple WordPress websites can prove difficult. With the MainWP Dashboard, posting content to various websites couldn’t be more natural.

Create the content, select your websites, and enjoy the time you saved.


= – Self-Hosted =

Your MainWP Dashboard is hosted on your own WordPress website and not on our private servers. We do not keep records of your actions, sites, passwords, or anything else. [Read Why that’s important!](https://mainwp.com/protect-your-data/)


= – Private =

We have 100% respect for your and your clients’ privacy. The developers do not have access to your WordPress sites or information. [Read Why that’s important!](https://mainwp.com/wordpress-manager-gdpr/)


= – Open Source Code =

The MainWP WordPress Manager Dashboard and Child plugins are fully open source and GPL compliant with no obfuscated code, so you always know what is running on your server.

Both plugins are also maintained on [GitHub](https://mainwp.com/github/) for easy code access.


= – Discovery Protection =

MainWP protects you from your competitors, search engines, or anyone else with prying eyes. Unless you tell them, no one will ever know you are using the MainWP WordPress management plugin.


= – Customize MainWP =

The MainWP [Custom Dashboard](https://mainwp.com/extension/mainwp-custom-dashboard-extension/) Extension offers custom functions and features so that users can tailor their WP management experience to their needs.


= – Developer? Code Your Own Extensions =

Built on WordPress’s core principles, the MainWP plugin allows third-party developers to “hook” into it, so anything you want can be developed for your MainWP Dashboard.

MainWP supports CLI and REST API and provides Hooks for different use cases. You can find more information on the [Develop MainWP Extensions](https://mainwp.com/develop-mainwp/) page.

Build around a proven WordPress Management System!


== – Partners ==

We are [partnered with industry-leading](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-extensions/) plugins and solutions to provide more flexibility.

If you want to build an Extension or integration for MainWP, you may get a massive boost. We may list it on our [Extensions page](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-extensions/) and market it, and with 1000 Extension installs, you could get 60k new active installations for your plugin.

== Installation ==

= Note: MainWP is not tested on or designed for multisite installs. =

However, we have reports that most functions work correctly, but support will be limited. We DO NOT recommend installing the MainWP Dashboard plugin on a multisite install.

1. We HIGHLY recommend a NEW WordPress install for your MainWP Dashboard.

Using a new WordPress install will help cut down on Plugin Conflicts and other issues caused by trying to run your MainWP Main Dashboard from an active site. Most hosting companies provide free subdomains ("demo.yourdomain.com"), and we recommend creating one if you do not have a specific dedicated domain to run your MainWP Dashboard.
If you are not sure how to set up a subdomain, contact your hosting company's support.

You can even install your MainWP Dashboard on a WordPress site located on your local computer using WAMP or any other setup that allows you to run [WordPress locally](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/).

2. Once you have set up the separate WordPress website, install the MainWP Dashboard plugin following your normal installation procedure, either the Automatic process by searching MainWP or by uploading the MainWP plugin to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

3. Once installed then Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.

4. Add your first Child Site to the MainWP Dashboard - [Documentation](https://kb.mainwp.com/docs/set-up-the-mainwp-plugin/add-site-to-your-dashboard/)

5. Set your MainWP Settings - [Documentation](https://kb.mainwp.com/docs/set-up-the-mainwp-plugin/mainwp-dashboard-settings/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I need any other plugins for MainWP? =
Yes, you need to install the [MainWP Child Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-child/) on the sites you want to control with the Dashboard plugin.

= Do you have any documentation? =
Yes, please review the [documentation site](https://kb.mainwp.com).

= I just want to start using MainWP, do you have a Quick Start Guide? =
Yes, please read the [Quick Start – Setting up your MainWP](https://mainwp.com/install-mainwp/).

= Where do I go for support or to ask for help? =
Please post in the [MainWP Community](https://managers.mainwp.com), or feel free to [contact us](https://mainwp.com/support/).

= What is the difference between ManageWP and MainWP? =
Essentially MainWP and ManageWP provide the same type of service but with different philosophies on WordPress management.

ManageWP is a Service as a Solution (SaaS) property owned by GoDaddy. The SaaS system makes ManageWP a type of "Walled Garden" with limited customization options.

MainWP follows the tradition of WordPress and is [open source](https://github.com/mainwp/mainwp), [private](https://mainwp.com/protect-your-data/), and [fully extendable](https://mainwp.dev). The fact that MainWP is open source and extendable means you have almost unlimited customization options, allowing you to run your WordPress management business as you see fit.
