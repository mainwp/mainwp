== Some Powerful MainWP Features: ==

MainWP is a feature-rich WP management plugin to manage multiple sites from a single self-hosted dashboard. Here are some of the highlighted features.

= – Easy WordPress Management =

MainWP, the WP Management plugin, eliminates the hassle of managing multiple sites by highlighting what needs to be done on each Child Site.

With the Easy [Plugin Manager feature](https://mainwp.com/easy-plugin-manager/), you can update specific plugins on selected Child Sites with just a click. Additionally, all themes and WordPress updates can be done the same way.


= – Full Client Management =

With the MainWP Client Management feature, you can create new profiles for your clients, add their contact person details, map websites to specific clients, add tags, suspend clients, and much more!

Take a look at how you can [easily manage your clients](https://kb.mainwp.com/docs/manage-clients/).


= – One-Click Login to wp-admin =

With the click of a button, you’re instantly and securely logged in to the wp-admin of a Child Site and ready to work! No need to remember usernames and passwords anymore!


= – Effortless Upgrades =

With the click of a button from your MainWP WordPress Manager Dashboard, all your WordPress sites will be upgraded to the latest stable version.


= – Automated Updates =

The Trusted Plugin and Theme option in your MainWP Dashboard will [automatically update](https://kb.mainwp.com/docs/manage-updates/) the Trusted Plugins and Themes without further interaction.

You will get an alert via email with available updates, and your Dashboard will auto-update them the next day.


= – Ignore Updates =

Is there a plugin or theme you want to avoid updating for compatibility or other issues? Just tell your MainWP Dashboard to ignore it, and it will no longer alert you of the update.


= – Abandoned Plugin and Theme Alerts =

When a plugin or theme hasn’t been updated in a long time, we tend to forget about it, which could lead to security or compatibility issues.

Your MainWP Dashboard will alert you of possibly abandoned plugins or themes so that you can look for a more updated plugin or theme.


= – Multiple Reliable Backup Options =

The MainWP Dashboard offers multiple backup options. Version 5 includes API Backups of popular hosting providers, and we have integrated some of the most popular backup plugins and released them as [Free Backup Extensions.](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-extensions/extension-category/backup/)

This allows you to use the backup plugins you know and trust directly from your MainWP Dashboard.



= – Self-Hosted =

Your MainWP Dashboard is hosted on your WordPress website, not our private servers. We do not keep records of your actions, sites, passwords, or anything else. [Read Why that’s important!](https://mainwp.com/protect-your-data/)


= – Private =

We have 100% respect for your and your client’s privacy. The developers do not have access to your WordPress sites or information. [Read Why that’s important!](https://mainwp.com/wordpress-manager-gdpr/)


= – Open Source Code =

The MainWP WordPress Manager Dashboard and Child plugins are fully open source and GPL compliant with no obfuscated code, so you always know what is running on your server.

Both plugins are also maintained on [GitHub](https://mainwp.com/github/) for easy code access.


= – Customize MainWP =

The MainWP [Custom Dashboard](https://mainwp.com/extension/mainwp-custom-dashboard-extension/) Extension offers custom functions and features so that users can tailor their WP management experience to their needs.


= – Developer? Code Your Own Extensions =

Built on WordPress’s core principles, the MainWP plugin allows third-party developers to “hook” into it, so anything you want can be developed for your MainWP Dashboard.

MainWP supports CLI and REST API and provides Hooks for different use cases. You can find more information on the [Develop MainWP Extensions](https://mainwp.com/develop-mainwp/) page.

== Installation ==

= Note: MainWP is not tested on or designed for multisite installs. =

However, we have reports that most functions work correctly, but support will be limited. We DO NOT recommend installing the MainWP Dashboard plugin on a multisite install.

1. We HIGHLY recommend a NEW WordPress install for your MainWP Dashboard.

Using a new WordPress install will help cut down on Plugin Conflicts and other issues caused by trying to run your MainWP Main Dashboard from an active site. Most hosting companies provide free subdomains ("demo.yourdomain.com"), and we recommend creating one if you do not have a specific dedicated domain to run your MainWP Dashboard.
If you are not sure how to set up a subdomain, contact your hosting company's support.

You can even install your MainWP Dashboard on a WordPress site located on your local computer using WAMP or any other setup that allows you to run [WordPress locally](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/).

2. Once you have set up the separate WordPress website, install the MainWP Dashboard plugin following your normal installation procedure, either the Automatic process by searching MainWP or by uploading the MainWP plugin to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

3. Once installed then Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.

4. Add your first Child Site to the MainWP Dashboard - [Documentation](https://kb.mainwp.com/docs/set-up-the-mainwp-plugin/add-site-to-your-dashboard/)

5. Set your MainWP Settings - [Documentation](https://kb.mainwp.com/docs/set-up-the-mainwp-plugin/mainwp-dashboard-settings/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between ManageWP and MainWP? =
Essentially MainWP and ManageWP provide the same type of service but with different philosophies on WordPress management.

ManageWP is a Service as a Solution (SaaS) property owned by GoDaddy. The SaaS system makes ManageWP a type of "Walled Garden" with limited customization options.

MainWP follows the tradition of WordPress and is [open source](https://github.com/mainwp/mainwp), [private](https://mainwp.com/protect-your-data/), and [fully extendable](https://mainwp.dev). The fact that MainWP is open source and extendable means you have almost unlimited customization options, allowing you to run your WordPress management business as you see fit.
