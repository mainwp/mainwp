Streamline your WordPress management with a powerful, self-hosted dashboard for updates, backups, security, cost tracking, and client management.

== Description ==

Managing multiple WordPress sites can be a time-consuming and frustrating task. The [MainWP Dashboard](https://mainwp.com/) empowers you to take back your time by allowing you to efficiently manage and secure all your WordPress sites from your own centralized Dashboard.

Designed for agencies, freelancers, and web professionals, MainWP offers comprehensive control with a privacy-first approach. Harness the power of MainWP for updates, backups, and more, ensuring your sites are always running smoothly and securely.

**Features for Advanced WordPress Management:**

* Centralized Updates: Keep all your WordPress sites up-to-date with single-click updates.
* Secure Backups: Implement scheduled or on-demand backups for complete site security.
* Manage both your sites and your clients with the Client Management module
* The built-in Cost Tracker allows you to easily keep track of client costs
* Private and Self-hosted: Your data stays yours, with full privacy and control.

**Stop the Software as a Service (SaaS) Treadmill:**

Built on WordPress's core principles, the MainWP Dashboard plugin is uniquely positioned as the go-to solution for WordPress management. It combines ease of use with robust features and unmatched privacy.

The MainWP plugins are open-source and privacy-focused and come with their own privacy policies to ensure that the plugins do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII).

The MainWP Dashboard is extendable, allowing third-party developers to hook into it. It also provides support for CLI and has its own REST API, so anything you need or want to run your business your way can be developed for your MainWP Dashboard.

All of this makes MainWP the best non-SaaS alternative to ManageWP, InfiniteWP, WPRemote, and WP Umbrella.

**Getting Started with MainWP:**

MainWP is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, even for those new to WordPress management plugins. With a straightforward setup process and a clean, organized dashboard, you'll be able to start managing your WordPress sites efficiently in no time.

* Setting up MainWP is straightforward—install the dashboard on a private WordPress site, add the MainWP Child plugin to your other WordPress sites, and take control.

**Your Guarantee of Privacy**

The MainWP plugins come with their own [privacy policies](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-plugin-privacy-policy/) to ensure that the plugins do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII).

**How Is MainWP Free? What’s the Catch? How Will You Continue to Pay Development Costs?**

MainWP Dashboard is [100% FREE](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-free-features/) and always will be. Whether you manage 5 sites or 5,000, the core dashboard remains free.

We make money by offering [MainWP Pro](https://mainwp.com/signup/), which provides access to a wide range of premium add-ons. These premium add-ons are organized into two clear categories:

- **Integrations:**
  Add-ons in this category enable seamless connections with popular third-party services and plugins, allowing you to integrate the tools you already use directly into your MainWP Dashboard.

- **Extensions:**
  These are custom-built, standalone add-ons developed exclusively for the MainWP Dashboard, designed to add unique and specialized functionality to enhance your WordPress management experience.

For more details, visit our [Premium Add-ons](https://mainwp.com/mainwp-add-ons/) page and see how our free and pro features compare at [Free vs. Pro: Know the Difference](https://mainwp.com/free-vs-pro/).

== Installation ==

= Note: MainWP is not tested on or designed for multisite installs. =

However, we have user reports that most functions work correctly, but support will be limited. We DO NOT recommend installing the MainWP Dashboard plugin on a multisite install.

1. We HIGHLY recommend a NEW WordPress install for your MainWP Dashboard.

Using a new WordPress install will help reduce Plugin Conflicts and other issues caused by trying to run your MainWP Dashboard from an active site.

Most hosting companies provide free subdomains ("demo.yourdomain.com"), and we recommend creating one if you do not have a specific dedicated domain to run your MainWP Dashboard. If you are not sure how to set up a subdomain, contact your hosting company's support.

You can even install your MainWP Dashboard on a WordPress site located on your local computer using WAMP or any other setup that allows you to run [WordPress locally](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/).

2. Once you have set up the separate WordPress website, install the MainWP Dashboard plugin following your normal installation procedure, either the automatic process by searching MainWP or by uploading the MainWP plugin to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

3. Once installed then Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.

4. Add your first Child Site to the MainWP Dashboard - [Documentation](https://mainwp.com/kb/set-up-the-mainwp-plugin/add-site-to-your-dashboard/)

5. Set your MainWP Settings - [Documentation](https://mainwp.com/kb/set-up-the-mainwp-plugin/mainwp-dashboard-settings/)
